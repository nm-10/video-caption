Andy Bird is with us, the CEO
of Pearson.

1
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.549
Andy, welcome.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.369
Thank you.

3
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.429
It's great to be here.

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.549
Great to see you in person.

5
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.709
I want to get into the share
price reaction.

6
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.459
Citi has put out a note this
morning saying results are

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.929
solid but lack a buyback.

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.629
That sizzle the market was
looking for.

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.829
Why didn't you go with a
buyback?

10
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.029
You didn't do one last year.

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.249
Why is there not one this year?

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.029
Well, we just completed a Â£350
million share buyback last year.

13
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.709
We have a very, very healthy
balance sheet.

14
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.509
In short, we want to maintain
optionality.

15
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.949
We want to see how the
beginning of this year plays out

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.159
and give ourselves that
optionality to see whether or

17
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.419
not â€“ how best to use the
strength of our balance sheet

18
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.569
going forward.

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.849
What does it mean in practice?

20
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.639
Are you saying you might want
to use the funds for an

21
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.189
acquisition?

22
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.379
Well, we made three
acquisitions last year in

23
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.429
Credly and Mondly.
