Andy Bird is with us, the CEO of Pearson. Andy, welcome.

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,239
Thank you. It's great to be here. Great to see you in

3
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:12,800
person. I want to get into the share price reaction.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,516
Citi has put out a note this morning saying results are

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,800
solid but lack a buyback.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,550
That sizzle the market was looking for.

7
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,485
Why didn't you go with a buyback? You didn't do one last

8
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:21,800
year.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,399
Why is there not one this year?

10
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:28,194
We just completed a Â£350 million share buyback last year.

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:33,092
We have a very healthy balance sheet. In short, we want to

12
00:00:33,092 --> 00:00:37,931
maintain optionality. We want to see how the beginning of

13
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:42,895
this year plays out and give ourselves that optionality to

14
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:48,018
see how best to use the strength of our balance sheet going

15
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:48,799
forward.

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,170
What does it mean in practice? Are you saying you might

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,979
want to use the funds for an acquisition?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,282
We made three acquisitions last year in Credly and Mondly

19
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:03,788
and more recently in our Pearson Vue business with PDRI. We

20
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:08,507
also want to be able to digest and integrate those

21
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:12,000
acquisitions into the broader group.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:38,000
