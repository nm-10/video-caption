00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.699
In this video we're going to
begin our introduction to

1
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.549
eukaryotic organelles or organs
inside of the cells.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.419
And so recall from our previous
lesson videos that eukaryotic

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:19.109
cells contain several membrane
bound organelles.

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.438
And so moving forward in our
course we're going to talk

5
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.669
about many of these membrane
bound organelles.

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.029
Now it's important to note that
both animal and plant cells are

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.709
eukaryotic, and so that means
that they both contain

8
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.019
eukaryotic organelles.

9
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.109
However, that being said, some
of the organelles of animal and

10
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.249
plant cells will actually
differ from each other, and so

11
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.939
that's important to keep in mind.

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.289
And so down below in our
example of eukaryotic

13
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.269
organelles, notice that we're
showing you our representation

14
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.699
of an animal cell over here on
the left-hand side.
